# ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset, designed to support automated diagnosis of HER2 breast cancer using histopathology images.

ðŸ§¬ Dataset Composition
Total Images: 9,746 high-resolution histopathology images

Image Types:
Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained images
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images

HER2 Expression Labels:
0, 1+, 2+, 3+ (indicating increasing levels of HER2 protein expression)

Split:
Training Set: 3,896 H&E + 3,896 IHC
Testing Set: 977 H&E + 977 IHC

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The dataset enables researchers and developers to:
- Train deep learning models for HER2 classification
- Analyze tissue morphology and staining patterns
- Explore multi-modal fusion of H&E and IHC images for improved accuracy
